### 👋 Hi there! I'm Anuj Paudyal

I'm a beginner passionate about **learning programming, building cool things**, and growing every day.

🧠 Currently learning: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, 'python', and `PHP`  
🚀 Goals for 2025:
- Build my first project (even a small one!)
- Collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source projects
- Learn Git, GitHub, and how to contribute
- Become consistent and confident in coding

💡 I'm here to learn, improve, and grow.  
📚 I believe small steps every day lead to big changes.  
🤝 I'm always open to connect with other learners and developers.
